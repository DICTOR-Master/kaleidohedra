# Kaleidoverse discoveries

*Kaleidoverse by DICTO — private working notes, 2026-10-01.*

Findings made while playing in Rhombiverse, Polyhedraverse and Kaleidoverse,
with how each one is verified and whether it appears to be new.
Every geometric claim here is checked exactly by a script that runs on every
push (`scripts/verify-kaleido.mjs` in this repo; `verify-zome-parallelohedra`
in Polyhedraverse; `verify-dicto-fcc` in Rhombiverse).

**Status** means only what a literature search on 2026-10-01 turned up
(Wikipedia, MathWorld, the Polytope Wiki, George Hart's zonohedra pages).
"Not found" is not proof of novelty; a specialist search (e.g. Fedorov /
Delone / Štogrin parallelohedra literature) is still needed before claiming
priority.

|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | DICTO skewed rhombic dodecahedron | DICTO (built in Zometool) | yes | **not found** — candidate |
| 2 | Equal-edge rule for sheared FCC | Kaleidoverse | yes | general idea known; this form not found |

## 1. DICTO skewed rhombic dodecahedron

A rhombic-dodecahedron-type space-filler whose four edge directions are
Zometool blue (icosahedral two-fold) lines meeting at **60° three times and
72° three times**, all edges equal. Its faces are 60° rhombi and 72° rhombi.
It splits into DICTO's two all-rhombus blocks (volume φ/2 each) and two
flattened rhombohedra (½ each), so its volume is exactly
**2·φ/2 + 2·½ = φ²** (the golden ratio's identity φ² = φ + 1 as a volume).
It tiles a sheared FCC lattice, DICTO FCC.

- Verified: Polyhedraverse `verify-zome-parallelohedra`, Rhombiverse
  `verify-dicto-fcc`, and here (path stop 2 with Cell = 1 is exactly this cell).
- Nearest known relative: the **Bilinski dodecahedron** (1960), also an
  RD-type space-filler with icosahedral edges, but its twelve faces are
  congruent golden rhombi (63.43°) and its edges lie on five-fold lines.
  DICTO's has two kinds of face (60° and 72°) on two-fold lines.
- Full write-up: Polyhedraverse `docs/dicto-zometool-discoveries.md`.

## 2. The equal-edge rule

Shear the FCC lattice any way at all. The RD-type cells that still tile the
sheared lattice are exactly the sheared RD's four edge directions, each
shifted by one common vector w; every w keeps all 12 neighbour
translations. **Exactly one** w makes all four edges equal: the circumcentre
of the four negated directions. That one cell is the regular RD for plain
FCC, and exactly DICTO's skewed RD for DICTO FCC. This is the Cell slider.

- Verified here: "Cell = 1 always has four equal edges", "the Cell slider
  keeps the lattice", and the two exact matches.
- Status: equilateral versions of any zonohedron type are well known (Hart;
  Wikipedia "Zonohedron"). The statement for a *fixed* sheared lattice, with
  a unique equal-edge member and the circumcentre construction, was not found.

## 3. Bain disphenoids

Stretch BCC by √2 along one cube axis and it becomes FCC. Of the six BCC
disphenoid orientations, the two whose long edges lie across that axis become
**regular tetrahedra**; the other four become quarters of regular octahedra.
Along the DICTO path the disphenoids only get less regular, and plain BCC is
the most regular overall (a regular tetrahedron cannot fill space alone).

- Verified here (Towards → Bain; the Disphenoids meter).
- Status: **known** — the Bain correspondence (E. C. Bain, 1924), standard in
  metallurgy. Kaleidoverse makes it something you can slide through and see.

## 4. Bain rhombic dodecahedron

At the Bain stop the equal-edge RD cell has edge directions meeting at
60, 60, 60, 60, 90, 90 degrees: **4 squares and 8 rhombi of 60°**, all edges
equal.

- Verified here ("Bain RD").
- Status: **known** — listed on Wikipedia's rhombic dodecahedron page as the
  D4h form, "a cuboctahedron with square pyramids attached on the top and
  bottom".

## 5. Regular-hexagon elongated dodecahedron

Add a fifth edge direction to the Bain RD along an unstretched cube axis, of
the same length. Every edge is 1, and the elongation direction lies at 60° to
two pairs of RD directions in their planes, so the faces are:

- **4 regular hexagons**
- **4 squares**
- **4 rhombi of 60°** (each two equilateral triangles)

It is an elongated-dodecahedron-type zonohedron, so it fills space by
translation (Fedorov). Every face is made of regular polygons. Elongated
along the stretched axis instead, it has 8 rhombi of 60° and 4 equal-edged
hexagons with corners 135°, 135°, 90° (a square with two corners cut at 45°).

- Verified here ("Bain ED along x", "Bain ED along z").
- Not the Polyhedraverse ED sheared: that one's elongation is the RD's edge
  √3/2 before the shear, giving hexagon edges 1, 1, 0.866. The regular-hexagon
  form needs the elongation 2/√3 times longer.
- Status: **not found.** Known ED forms: the standard one (MathWorld: 80.4°
  rhombi, equilateral hexagons with 131.8° corners), the contracted truncated
  octahedron (60° rhombi, no squares), and cube-volume and concave variants.
  None has regular hexagons with squares.
